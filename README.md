The purpose of this project was to create a website for a real client, in this case for Salsamentaria La Esperanza, which is a store dedicated to the sale of meat products. They want to achieve greater visibility as they have been in the market for more than 20 years, adding that during the pandemic, they noticed that it was even more necessary to have a website where customers have access to the view of the products through the shopping cart and can contact through WhatsApp about any concerns that the user has.
